# json-image-metadata (JIM)

A specifiction for expressing technical image metadata, with an emphasis on accessibility of data visualizations.

The shortname for this specification is JIM, in honor of [Jim Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_W._Thatcher), the inventor of the screen reader and the subsequent GUI screen reader. Variants using other encodings than JSON should retain the shortname as an orphan initialism.
